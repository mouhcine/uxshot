I’m a UX Designer who think about the Person, his reactions, his behaviours.

My purpose is understanding and measuring his experience, thinking also out of his interaction with UI.
So I can discover missing in UI + UX that obstacles caching of the target, of himself one and product’s one.

Catching problems and needs I can start with executive phase.

I create sketching on paper to identify as many solutionsas it’s needed to solve the problem.
Avoiding not working sketch, I convert conveying ones in working prototypes, taking care about interactions, animations and flows.
In that phase I think to how and what iit’s necessary to persuade people and to answer to his needs, thinking to aims of product too.

Finally I define mockup and I iter with development team, via agile method, about realisation o prototypes and the definition of what measeuring to defy the straight of the work.


This is what I take care of.
