I’m an UI-UX Designer who think about the Person, human behaviours and emotions.

My purpose is understanding and driving experiences: I have a strong desire to find product problems and customer needs and to solve them with design.
Make life easier for huge user bases products is my persuasion.

Everything starts with right questions: from the answers I create sketchings on paper to identify as many solutions it’s needed to achieve goals. Avoiding not working sketch, I convert conveying ones in working prototypes, taking care about interactions, animations and flows.
I share prototype with stakeholder and developer to collect feedback in order to refine the prototype and taking care about the details.
After that I iterate with developers to give life to the prototype.

I have experience in UI design of iOS and Android native apps, following two different operating system patterns, and responsive web-application too.

I have a deep interest of psychology and recently I’m discovering and studing ux research methods.
